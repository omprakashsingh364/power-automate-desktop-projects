# Rule-Based Process Automation using Power Automate Desktop

## Overview
This repository documents a personal automation project built using
Power Automate Desktop (PAD), Excel, and JavaScript.

The automation focuses on reducing manual effort by using
rule-based decision logic that learns from user inputs.

> ⚠️ Note: PAD flow files are not uploaded due to tool limitations
and data confidentiality. This repository showcases architecture,
logic, and implementation approach.

## Problem Statement
- Manual claim processing was time-consuming
- Hardcoded logic required frequent updates
- Manual inputs caused delays and inconsistencies

---

## Solution Design
- Built end-to-end PAD automation
- Implemented rule-based learning logic
- Stored rules in structured Excel files
- Used Boolean conditions for fast rule matching
- Integrated JavaScript for performance improvement
- Used JSON-based objects to reduce variable complexity

---

## Key Outcomes
- ~80% automation achieved
- Processing time reduced from ~2 min to ~1 min per case
- Maintained 98–99% accuracy
- Reduced dependency on manual decision-making

---

## Technologies Used
- Power Automate Desktop (PAD)
- Excel (Advanced, VBA)
- JavaScript (logic integration)
