## Rule-Based Learning Logic

1. Read input data from PAD by selecting config files
2. Read multiple Excel files in Memory
3. Convert structured JSON to custom object
4. Match Java scripts output against existing rules stored in Excel
5. If rule exists:
   - Apply logic automatically
6. If rule does not exist:
   - Prompt user for decision
   - Store new rule in Excel
7. Use Boolean filters for faster future matching
8. Reuse rules for subsequent executions
